# IsMyAlpacaHoodieAvailable
This script monitors Appalachian Gear Company website for hoodie availability and sends a notification email when provided search parameters are met and a hoodie is available to buy.

I have been trying to buy an alpaca hoodie from their website for nearly a year now and with no success. They have very limited stock and available every few months or so. Whenever new hoodies are available they are gone from the website within hours.

For the given reasons I decided to write a script that will monitor the website activity for me and send me an email when my hoodie is finally available. I thought I'd share this script with other people if anyone wants to get an alpaca hoodie from them. Hopefully it will increase your chances of buying it whlist it's available. Perfect gift for Christmas too!
